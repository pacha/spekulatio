_Command tool to transform directories based on rules._

With Spekulatio, you can create an output directory by applying transformation
rules to one or more input directories. This generic tool can help you render
YAML manifests, be used as "cookie cutter" to bootstrap project directories, or
serve as a static site generator. When used as a static site generator,
Spekulatio stands out as one of the least opinionated tools out there, allowing
you to set your own directory structure, write HTML without having to adapt it
to predefined sections or having to use any specific JavaScript framework.
